#KNN and SVM Experimentation on Wine and Iris Datasets

This repository contains the code and results of an experiment comparing the performance of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) algorithms on two popular datasets: Wine and Iris.

#Overview

In this experiment, we aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of KNN and SVM algorithms in classification tasks using the Wine and Iris datasets. We implemented both algorithms and trained them on each dataset separately. Then, we measured their accuracy scores to compare their performance.

#Datasets

Wine Dataset: This dataset contains the results of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy. It consists of 178 samples with 13 features.

Iris Dataset: This well-known dataset contains measurements of iris flowers, with three classes of iris species and four features.

Algorithm Implementation: We implemented the KNN and SVM algorithms using appropriate libraries (e.g., scikit-learn).

Model Training: We trained both algorithms on the training data from each dataset.

Model Evaluation: We evaluated the trained models on the test data and calculated accuracy scores for each algorithm.
